Specific Aim 1 will examine the adverse impact of environmental chemicals in fasting blood samples measured by HRM on obesity (i.e., total body fat and body mass index (BMI)), metabolic dysfunction (e.g., fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and insulin resistance), and obesity-induced inflammation (i.e., leptin) among 104 Southern California adolescents enrolled in the CHS. Specific Aim 2 will examine associations of childhood exposures to PM2.5 and traffic-related air pollutants (i.e., CALINE model-predicted NOx) with biological metabolites identified in fasting blood samples using HRM among 104 adolescents in the CHS. Specific Aim 3 will investigate the metabolic pathways linking air pollution exposures and obesity and type 2 diabetes-related traits using pathway analysis under bayesian hierarchical model among 104 adolescents in the CHS.",

Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), the most frequent T2D complication, is characterized by sensory peripheral nerve damage. Although managing glucose effectively slows DPN progression in type 1 diabetes patients, it has limited efficacy in neuropathic T2D patients. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) recently emerged as a major risk factor for DPN; however, the metabolites associated with MetS that correlate with DPN are unknown. We conducted a global plasma metabolomics analysis from a cohort of patients enrolled in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch study of Intensive Treatment of Diabetes in Primary Care (ADDITION), including healthy control subjects, T2D patients, and T2D DPN patients. We identified 15 total plasma metabolites that were altered in T2D DPN patients, including lipids, amino acids, and energy-related metabolites. We evaluated the correlation between these metabolites and all lipid species to identify major changes in both plasma free fatty acids and complex lipids in T2D DPN patients, and found significant alterations in the abundance of long-chain saturated fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and sphingolipids. Our study suggests that DPN in T2D is associated with novel alterations in plasma metabolites related to lipid metabolism.",

To develop safe and potent therapeutics, insights into the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are urgently needed. We reported the multi-omics profiling of the liver and sera of both peripheral blood and hepatic portal vein blood from Macaca fascicularis with spontaneous diabetes mellitus with a chow diet. The other two groups of the monkeys fed with chow diet and high-sugar high-fat (HSHF) diet, respectively, were included for comparison. These multi-omics datasets can provide a comprehensive picture of the molecular changes caused by diabetes in primates. Analyses of various omics datasets revealed the alterations of high consistency. Correlation between transcripts and proteins derived from the same genes was observed across individuals for most genes, especially the ones of differential expression. As a result, we found that distinct patterns of the metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome between spontaneous diabetes and HSHF diet-induced diabetes compared with healthy individuals.",

Sixty-eight pregnant women with overweight/obesity from a clinical trial of a lifestyle intervention were included. Participants who developed GDM (n=34; GDM group) were matched on treatment group, age, body mass index, and ethnicity with those who did not develop GDM (n=34; Non-GDM group). Blood draws were completed early in pregnancy (10-16 weeks). Plasma samples were analyzed by UPLC-MS using three metabolomics assays. ",
