# Introduction
Metabolomics Workbench (link) hosts a metabolomics data repository. It contains 
over 1000 publicly available studies including raw data, processed data and 
metabolite/compound information.

The repository is searchable using a REST service API. The metabolomicsWorkbenchR
package makes the endpoints of this service available in R and provides functionality
to search the database and import datasets and metabolite information into commonly used formats such as 
data frames and SummarizedExperiment objects.

# Installation
